# AI Annotations

A set of Java annotations for marking AI-assisted code.

## Use Cases

- **Setting expectations** – Signal to other developers that code may require closer review or may follow different patterns than hand-written code.
- **Legal and compliance** – Help organizations track AI-generated code for licensing, intellectual property, or regulatory compliance assessments.
- **Model versioning** – Identify code generated by older AI models that may benefit from revision with newer, more capable models.
- **Quality tracking** – Correlate defect rates or maintenance burden with AI-generated vs. human-written code.
- **Auditing** – Provide traceability for codebases where AI usage must be documented or disclosed.
- **Code review prioritization** – Flag AI-generated sections for additional human scrutiny before deployment.

## Annotations

| Annotation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `@AIGenerated` | Code that was fully generated by AI |
| `@AIAssisted` | Code written with AI assistance |
| `@AIRefactored` | Code that was refactored by AI |
| `@AIReviewed` | Code that was reviewed by AI |
| `@AISuggested` | Code based on AI suggestions |
| `@HumanVerified` | AI-generated code that has been verified by a human |

## Usage

```java
@AIGenerated(model = "GPT-4", date = "2025-12-11")
public class Example {
    // ...
}
```
